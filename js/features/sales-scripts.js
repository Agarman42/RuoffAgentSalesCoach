AGENT PROFILE:
${personalization}

Generate exactly 4 varied, natural scripts for this situation:

Situation: "${scenario}"

${context ? `Additional context: ${context}` : ''}
${scriptElements.length ? `Must naturally incorporate these elements where they fit: ${scriptElements.map(e => '• ' + e).join(' ')}` : ''}

Requirements for each script:
- 3–6 sentences long
- Warm, curious, helpful — never salesy or pushy
- Use open-ended questions
- Include a soft next step
- End with a gentle call-to-action
- Tone: Match the agent's natural voice and personality from the profile above
- Make it sound like this specific person wrote it

CRITICAL FORMATTING:
- Start each with ## **Script 1** (bold header), ## **Script 2**, etc.
- Use **bold** for light emphasis where it feels natural
- Use - bullet points when listing questions, benefits, or ideas
- Separate paragraphs with a blank line
- Do NOT use code blocks

Focus on building connection and trust — not closing the deal.`;
